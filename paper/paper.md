# Summary

- Matrix Studio is an Open Source and multiplatform Integrated Development Environment to code in pure OpenCL. It allows the coding and execution of OpenCL functions, kernels and their scheduling with an advanced graphical user interface.
- The developers avoid the arduous host part and only concentrate on the OpenCL code. The core of Matrix Studio can be embedded in any other java code to execute OpenCL programs.
- Matrix Studio was firstly designed for researchers in computational biology and teachers in multicore programming.
- The source code (MIT licence) is avalaible at [@MatrixStudioGitHUB].  Tutorials, exercices and courses can be downloaded at [@MatrixStudioUserWebsite]. Researches and other examples of Matrix Studio applications can be seen at [@MatrixStudioExamples].
- A simple video tutorial can be seen at [@MatrixStudioShortTutorial].
